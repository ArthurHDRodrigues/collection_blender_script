# collection_blender_script

## Summary

This is a small collection of minor Python scripts tha I've done to generate objects in Blender >=2.80.

You may check how to run the scripts in the [official documentation site](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html#running-scripts).

This collection contains scripts for
- [8-figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure-eight_knot_(mathematics));
- [Mobius Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip).

## 8-figure

This script generate a sequence of edges that topologically speaking is the 8 knot.

I used the parametrization given by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure-eight_knot_(mathematics)).

## Mobius Strip

This is an adaptation(to run in Blender 2.80) of Bob's script to generate a mobius strip. You may find the original in this [post](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/82480/how-to-make-a-mobius-strip).
